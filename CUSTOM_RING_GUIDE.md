## Custom Rings Guide
Welcome to the guide for making custom rings using SETT. Best of luck!
### Preface
- I use [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) as an image editing software as it is free and has layers (feel free to use whatever software you want though, the general concepts should apply)
- [Ring creation Style Guide](https://foundryvtt.com/article/dynamic-token-rings/)
## Makeing your Ring and BG
1. For this example I'm going to be using a ring and background from Eldritch Dream[.](https://ko-fi.com/eldritchdream)
2. To start with I usually start off of this template as my base iamge as it makes it easier to read

3. Add a new layer with your ring sized up to 2048px x 2048px

4. Select your ring later and scale the Ring so that the inner part matches up with where the Magenta ring meets the grey circle. (In `Paint.net` use `Ctrl + Shift + Z` and then use the zoom to resize it easily _also upgrade the quality to have it result in a better looking image_)

6. Add a new layer with your ring background sized up to 2048px x 2048px behind the ring layer (If you don't have one i've also included a [default one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChasarooniZ/More-Dynamic-Token-Rings/master/tutorial/ring_background_DEFAULT.webp))
7. Scale the background like in **step 4** so that it fills up all the area behind the ring but doesn't go past the ring

8. Toggle off the Template background layer

9. Toggle off the Ring background layer

10. Save the Ring Image with either a `.png` or `.webp` file type

12. Do the same for the Background Image as in **Step 10**
