## Creating New Rings
Have a normal token ring that you want to become a dynamic ring. Just make a simple PR and I will add it to the module:
- **IMPORTANT** - To add a token ring while complying with ToS, You must have either __Ownership of the ring__ used (and give permission), or the __license and source that show the ring is free to use__ for this module
0. Pre prep, you'll need to get the following: A copy of your token ring and background (as seperate images) that meets the following standards laid out in FvTT's [guide to dynamic token rings](https://foundryvtt.com/article/dynamic-token-rings/)

> It is also recommended to add the magenta coloration for parts of the token ring that should animate and change color

1. Take a (2048px x 2048px) version of your Ring + Background and [register an issue](https://github.com/ChasarooniZ/More-Dynamic-Token-Rings/issues/new?assignees=ChasarooniZ&labels=Ring+Submission&projects=&template=submit-a-new-ring.md&title=%5BRing+Submission%5D+) here.
