Ideally attach a copy of your ring's sprite sheet, you can [Follow the guide here](https://github.com/ChasarooniZ/More-Dynamic-Token-Rings?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-new-rings).
_just realized it saves as webp and github won't let you directly attach it..._
also here is a default background if you don't have one [default token bg](https://github.com/ChasarooniZ/More-Dynamic-Token-Rings/blob/master/tutorial/ring_background_DEFAULT.webp)

### Ring Name
Name of the ring

### Ring Licensing
Put licensing/link to licensing here, or if its yours just be like, "Oh this is mine and I'd love for you to add it to this module or something"

### Plug your Stuff
 Give me a link to either your Linktree/patreon/ etc. so people can go checkout your stuff/support you if they like your ring (you only need to fill out this part once)
 _If you don't put have anything to plug, i'll link your profile to a verified charity instead_

### Misc
For anything else that needs to be note (special color FX radii etc.
